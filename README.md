# PubMed-scraper

This script extracts journal article titles (as strings in a list) by an author's name from PubMed.<br>
(For a future use in a Markov Chain.)<br>
<br>
Version 1: used lxml but only worked for the first 20 author's journal articles.<br>
<br>
Version 2: inspired by https://github.com/paulgribble/PubMedPythonStuff; uses beautiful soup; works for all (and any number of) author's journal articles.<br>
